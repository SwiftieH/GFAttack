## Requirements
The script has been tested running under Python 3.6.5, with the following packages installed (along with their dependencies):
* tensorflow (tested on 1.14.0)
* scipy (tested on 1.2.1)
* numpy (tested on 1.17.2)

## Run
- 2 order of graph filter, selecting Top-128 smallest eigen-values/vectors.
```bash
python main.py --dataset cora --K 2 --T 128
```
We only did Top-128 and Top-Half largest eigen-values/vectors to get the results in paper. To get better performance, tuning the hyper-parameters is highly encouraged.
